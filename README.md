# PPO-Training-on-HalfCheetah-Gymnasium


This project trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent on the HalfCheetah-v4 environment using Stable-Baselines3.

## Project Structure

- `train_ppo.py` – trains the PPO agent and logs episode rewards
- `plot_learning.py` – plots the learning curve from training logs
- `record_video.py` – records a video of the trained agent
- `ppo_halfcheetah_learning_curve.png` – learning curve visualization

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- gymnasium
- stable-baselines3
- mujoco
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
